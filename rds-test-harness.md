boto3: The AWS SDK for Python. It allows you to create, configure, and manage AWS services.
logging: A built-in Python module for logging messages.
argparse: A built-in Python module for parsing command-line arguments.
getpass: A built-in Python module that prompts the user for a password without echoing.
sqlalchemy: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
Logging Setup
python
Copy code
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
This line sets up the logging module to display messages with a severity level of INFO or higher.
Function: create_rds_instance
This function creates a new RDS instance.

python
Copy code
def create_rds_instance(client, db_engine):
client: The boto3 RDS client.
db_engine: The database engine (e.g., "postgres").
Inside the function:

Prompt the user for the database name, master username, and master password.
Try to create an RDS instance with the provided details.
Wait until the RDS instance is available.
Return the endpoint address, database name, username, and password.
Function: check_instance_exists
This function checks if an RDS instance with a given identifier exists.

python
Copy code
def check_instance_exists(client, db_instance_identifier):
client: The boto3 RDS client.
db_instance_identifier: The identifier of the RDS instance to check.
Inside the function:

Try to describe the RDS instance with the given identifier.
If it exists, return its endpoint address. Otherwise, return None.
Function: create_and_read_table
This function creates a table in the database and reads its content.

python
Copy code
def create_and_read_table(host, dbname, user, password):
host: The endpoint address of the RDS instance.
dbname: The name of the database.
user: The master username.
password: The master password.
Inside the function:

Use SQLAlchemy to connect to the database.
Create a table named test_table if it doesn't exist.
Insert a row into the table.
Read and print all rows from the table.
Function: main
This is the main function that orchestrates the script's flow.

Inside the function:

Set up argument parsing to get the user's choice (create a new RDS instance or use an existing one).
If the choice is to create a new instance:
Prompt the user for the database engine.
Create the RDS instance.
If the choice is to use an existing instance:
Prompt the user for the RDS instance identifier.
Check if the instance exists.
If it exists, prompt the user for the database name, username, and password.
Create and read a table in the database.
Execution
python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
This block ensures that the main function is called only when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).
Pseudo Output
If the user chooses to create a new RDS instance:
csharp
Copy code
Enter the database engine (for this example, use 'postgres'): postgres
Enter the database name for the new RDS instance: mydb
Enter the master username for the new RDS instance: admin
Enter the master password for the new RDS instance: [password]
RDS instance is being created...
RDS instance created and available.
Table created.
Data inserted.
(1, 'test_name')
If the user chooses to use an existing RDS instance:
mathematica
Copy code
Enter the DBInstanceIdentifier for the existing RDS instance: myexistingdb
RDS instance myexistingdb exists.
Enter the database name for the existing RDS instance: mydb
Enter the master username for the existing RDS instance: admin
Enter the master password for the existing RDS instance: [password]
Table created.
Data inserted.
(1, 'test_name')
Note: Before running the script, ensure you have the necessary AWS permissions and have set up your AWS credentials. Also, ensure you have installed the required Python packages (boto3, sqlalchemy, etc.).
